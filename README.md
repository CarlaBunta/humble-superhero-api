# Humble Superhero API

## Collaboration
When working with a teammate on this project, I would:
- Do regular sync-ups to discuss feature implementation
- Use pair programming for complex logic
- Conduct code reviews to ensure quality and learn from each other
- Maintain clear communication about project goals and challenges
- Ask for feedback & offer feedback

## If I Had More Time
- Implement persistent storage (database integration)
- Add authentication for superhero submissions
- Create more advanced filtering of superhero list
- Develop comprehensive error handling
- Add unit and integration tests
- Design a better UI
- Add small superhero related game in the first page

## Technical Highlights
- React frontend with dynamic form submission
- Express.js backend with in-memory data storage
- Simple but extensible superhero recruitment API
- Lottie animation for playful user experience
